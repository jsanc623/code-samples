These are a collection of classes which act as the backbone to one of my
proprietary systems that I am currently working on as of June 2012. 

These classes interface between Foursquare, Yahoo Locals and the backend database
as well as Google Maps to determine what the user is searching for, 
where the user is searching for that data, as well as returning a list of 
places that match the search parameters and location given by the user.

This code is incomplete and is something that I am still building upon.

Many instructions left that I still have to bum off :)
